### Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Hi there!

My name is Shrusti (you can also call me Ghela), and I am a Data Scientist!

I have always been a math geek, and my love for math, solving puzzles, and finding patterns led me to do engineering during my UG days. I studied IT at the Vellore Institute of Technology, and this is where I learned to combine my love for patterns with data. 

I became passionate about turning data-driven insights into powerful narratives and stories. This passion triggered my next jump to the University of Washington. At UW, I completed a master's in Data Science and worked as a Text Mining Specialist at the eScience Institute. I collaborated with researchers to solve NLP problems that helped create powerful computer systems with the ability to understand human language. How cool is that? 

Currently, I am a Data Science intern at Constellation Software Inc., where I solve problems using data.

So that's me! A data junkie who is fascinated by every aspect the Dataverse has to offer, combined with a curiosity to uncover stories and build solutions!
